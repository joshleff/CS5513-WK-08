# Basic Full Stack App with Firestore database

In this assignment I extended the code from [this tutorial](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-create-todo-app-with-nextjs-firebase-383dcee65076) to create a to-do app.
To experiment more with **CRUD** operations in **Google Firestore**,
I added a counter which updates a count in a database.
Written in **Javascript**, it uses **Next.js**,
**Chakra UI React** components, and **Google Firebase** authentication.
